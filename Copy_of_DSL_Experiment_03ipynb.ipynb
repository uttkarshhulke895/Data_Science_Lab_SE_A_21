        "The task asked to summarize the results of the determinant calculation, matrix inversion, and the solution to the system of linear equations.\n",
        "\n",
        "1.  **Determinant Calculation Result:** The determinant of the initial 3x3 matrix `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]` was found to be approximately zero.\n",
        "2.  **Matrix Inversion Result:** Due to its determinant being approximately zero, the 3x3 matrix was identified as singular and therefore does not have an inverse.\n",
        "3.  **Solution to the System of Linear Equations:** The system of equations `2x + 3y = 10` and `4x + 5y = 20` was solved, yielding the solution `x = 5` and `y = 0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Data Analysis Key Findings\n",
        "*   A 3x3 matrix, `matrix_a = [[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8, 9]]`, was successfully created using NumPy.\n",
        "*   The determinant of `matrix_a` was calculated using `np.linalg.det()` and found to be approximately `0`.\n",
        "*   As a direct consequence of its near-zero determinant, `matrix_a` was determined to be singular, and thus `np.linalg.inv()` could not compute its inverse. An appropriate message indicating its non-invertibility was displayed.\n",
        "*   A 2x2 coefficient matrix `[[2, 3], [4, 5]]` and a constant vector `[10, 20]` were defined for the system of linear equations `2x + 3y = 10` and `4x + 5y = 20`.\n",
        "*   The system of linear equations was successfully solved using `np.linalg.solve()`, yielding the solution `x = 5` and `y = 0`.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Insights or Next Steps\n",
        "*   When performing matrix inversion, it's crucial to check the determinant first to confirm the matrix is non-singular and avoid errors.\n",
        "*   NumPy's linear algebra functions (`np.linalg.det`, `np.linalg.inv`, `np.linalg.solve`) provide efficient and robust methods for common linear algebra operations.\n"
